They found cryptic TSSs that generated spliced variants, half of which were in-frame isoforms (and some of which resulted in chimeric transcripts, others original or truncated). This got me thinking about our project and whether we could see these chimeric/fusion transcripts (that are skewed toward the 5'end due Cage-seq and being TSS-induced) in HL60s.  \n",

    "This is an interesting paper which claims genetic alterations to DNA methylation core genes drive dysregulated hematopoietic development due to CpG changes that regulate transcription factor binding (figure 4 and 5). How many TFs are methylation sensitive has been controversial in my understanding but is an interesting idea with lots of data within mylomonocytic cells. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0595-4\n",
