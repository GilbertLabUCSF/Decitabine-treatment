Writing Output...
WARNING: The data appears to be STRANDED, following the fr_secondStrand rule.
         Are you sure this isn't stranded data? If it is stranded, then you should probably
         re-run QoRTs with the "--stranded" and "--stranded_fr_secondstrand" options!
QoRTs completed WITH WARNINGS! See log for details.
Done.
