# Note: if this file EXISTS, then QoRTs QC completed WITH WARNINGS. Warning messages follow:
Warning: run-in-progress file "iso/rawCts/hl60_120h_u_2//QC.QORTS_RUNNING" already exists. Is there another QoRTs job running?
WARNING: QoRTs is unable to infer the strandedness from the data!
         This isn't a problem per-se, since QoRTs requires that strandedness
         mode be set manually. However, it might be indicative that something
         is very wrong with your dataset and/or transcript annotation.
QoRTs completed WITH WARNINGS! See log for details.
